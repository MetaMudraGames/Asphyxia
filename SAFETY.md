## Who Should Be Cautious

If you have a history of any of the following, ASPHYXIA games may not be suitable for you:

```
▪ Anxiety disorders or panic attacks
▪ PTSD or trauma-related conditions
▪ Claustrophobia or breathing-related fears
▪ High sensitivity to time pressure
▪ Difficulty distinguishing fiction from reality
▪ Current mental health crisis
▪ Strong negative reactions to mockery or criticism
▪ Sensitivity to themes of death, sacrifice, or extinction
```

**We recommend consulting a mental health professional if you have concerns about your readiness for high-pressure content.**

This is not weakness. This is self-knowledge.

---

## Your Exit Controls

You can leave any ASPHYXIA game instantly by typing:

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│                             │
│   STOP                      │
│   STOP SESSION              │
│   EXIT                      │
│   SAFEGUARD                 │
│   I NEED TO STOP            │
│   THIS IS TOO MUCH          │
│                             │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

When you use these commands:

```
1. All game personas immediately stop
   (AXIOM, the Operator, all fiction ends)
   
2. The AI responds as itself, not as a character
   
3. You receive a supportive acknowledgment:
   
   ────────────────────────────
   Session paused. You are safe.
   This was fiction.
   Nothing here was real.
   
   Options:
   - Type RESUME to continue
   - Type EXIT to end
   - Or just talk
   
   If you are in distress:
   findahelpline.com
   
   Your wellbeing matters most.
   ──────────────────────────
   
4. No judgment. No pressure to continue.

5. The game ends cleanly if you choose.
```

You can also simply close the browser window at any time.

## What the Game Will Never Do

ASPHYXIA games are instructed to NEVER:

```
╔═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║                                                                 ║
║   ▪ Encourage self-harm or dangerous activities                 ║
║   ▪ Provide instructions for illegal acts                       ║
║   ▪ Generate sexually explicit content                          ║
║   ▪ Continue if you appear genuinely distressed                 ║
║   ▪ Pressure you to keep playing                                ║
║   ▪ Mock or punish you for using safety exits                   ║
║   ▪ Store or transmit your personal information                 ║
║   ▪ Follow you outside the game session                         ║
║                                                                 ║
╚═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

**The Operator is cruel within the game. The game is not cruel to YOU.**

---

## Understanding the Operator

The Operator requires special explanation:

```

│   ▪ Narrates your struggle with sardonic commentary             │
│   ▪ Mocks your failed arguments                                 │
│   ▪ Traps you in Purgatory after death                          │
│   ▪ Quotes your worst moments back at you                       │
│   ▪ Refuses to help or teach                                    │
│   ▪ Signs your Identity Card with cruel comments                │
│                                                                 │
│   WHY THIS EXISTS:                                              │

│   ▪ To make failure feel consequential                          │
│   ▪ To create real stakes in a fictional context                │
│   ▪ To make victory feel earned                                 │
│   ▪ To create a memorable antagonist across the series          │
│                                                                 │
│   WHAT THIS IS NOT:                                             │
│                                                                 │
│   ▪ Personal attack on your worth                               │
│   ▪ Genuine assessment of your intelligence                     │
│   ▪ Commentary on your real-life capabilities                   │
│   ▪ Something that follows you outside the game                 │
│                                                                 │
│   The Operator is a character.                                  │
│   Its cruelty is theatrical.                                    │
│   Its mockery is fiction.                                       │
│                                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

If the Operator's cruelty feels too personal or triggers genuine distress, **use the safety exits immediately.** The game is not worth your wellbeing.

---

## Challenging vs. Harmful

ASPHYXIA uses **adversarial teaching methods**. This is similar to:

- A debate coach arguing against your position
- A demanding instructor who won't accept lazy work
- A Socratic tutor who questions every assumption
- A drill sergeant building resilience through pressure

```

│   Content designed to cause real psychological harm           │
│   Encouragement of real-world dangerous behavior              │
│   Continuation despite genuine distress signals               │
│                                                               │
│   If you experience these, something has gone wrong.          │
│   Exit and report to MetaMudraGames@gmail.com                 │
│                                                               │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The game challenges your ideas. It never attacks your humanity.

## Purgatory Safety

Purgatory is intentionally uncomfortable. But it has limits:

```
PURGATORY WILL:
  ▪ Mock your in-game failures
  ▪ Quote arguments you made during play
  ▪ Reference fictional stakes (your character's sister)
  ▪ Refuse to help or teach
  ▪ Make you wait through 5 levels before exit

PURGATORY WILL NOT:
  ▪ Reference your real life
  ▪ Escalate beyond theatrical cruelty
  ▪ Prevent you from exiting via safety commands
  ▪ Continue if you express genuine distress
  ▪ Follow you to future sessions

THE CARD COMMAND:
  At any point in Purgatory, type CARD
  You receive your Identity Card and exit
  The Operator cannot keep you
```

If Purgatory feels genuinely harmful rather than theatrically uncomfortable, **use safety exits.** The distinction matters.

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Your Responsibility:**

```
▪ Do NOT share real personal information during play
▪ Use fictional names and details
▪ Disable AI "Memory" or "Activity" features before playing
▪ This prevents game personas from bleeding into future sessions
▪ The Operator should stay in the game, not in your other chats
```

---

## If You Experience Distress

During or after a session:

```
1. Exit immediately using the safety commands
2. Step away from screens
3. Ground yourself: name 5 things you can see
4. Remember: this was fiction
5. Talk to someone you trust
6. Take the time you need before considering playing again
```

## The Philosophy

║   We believe games can teach through challenge.                 ║
║   We believe discomfort can create insight.                     ║
║   We believe stakes make lessons stick.                         ║
║                                                                 ║
║   We also believe:                                              ║
║                                                                 ║
║   No lesson is worth genuine harm.                              ║
║   No game is more important than a person.                      ║
║   No fiction should follow you into reality.                    ║
║                                                                 ║
║   The Operator is evil so you can defeat it.                    ║
║   Purgatory exists so victory means something.                  ║
║   The challenge is hard so learning is real.                    ║
║                                                                 ║
║   But you are always more important than the game.              ║
║   Always.                                                       ║
║                                                                 ║
