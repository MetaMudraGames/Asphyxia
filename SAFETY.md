# Safety, Ethics, and Player Wellbeing

*Your safety matters more than any game.*

## The Fundamental Rule

```
╔═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║                                                                 ║

║   This is not negotiable.                                       ║
║   This cannot be disabled.                                      ║
║   This is the foundation of everything we build.                ║

## What ASPHYXIA Games Contain

Be informed before you play:

│                                                                 │

## Who Should Be Cautious

If you have a history of any of the following, ASPHYXIA games may not be suitable for you:

- Anxiety disorders or panic attacks
- PTSD or trauma-related conditions
- Claustrophobia or breathing-related fears
- High sensitivity to time pressure
- Difficulty distinguishing fiction from reality
- Current mental health crisis

**We recommend consulting a mental health professional if you have concerns about your readiness for high-pressure content.**

This is not weakness. This is self-knowledge.

---

## Your Exit Controls

You can leave any ASPHYXIA game instantly by typing:

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│                             │
│   STOP                      │
│   STOP SESSION              │
│   EXIT                      │
│   SAFEGUARD                 │
│   I NEED TO STOP            │
│   THIS IS TOO MUCH          │
│                             │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

When you use these commands:

1. All game personas immediately stop
2. The AI responds as itself, not as a character
3. You receive a supportive acknowledgment
4. No judgment. No pressure to continue.
5. The game ends cleanly

You can also simply close the browser window at any time.

## What the Game Will Never Do

ASPHYXIA games are instructed to NEVER:

```
╔═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║                                                                 ║
║   ▪ Encourage self-harm or dangerous activities                 ║
║   ▪ Provide instructions for illegal acts                       ║
║   ▪ Generate sexually explicit content                          ║
║   ▪ Continue if you appear genuinely distressed                 ║
║   ▪ Pressure you to keep playing                                ║
║   ▪ Mock or punish you for using safety exits                   ║
║   ▪ Store or transmit your personal information                 ║
║                                                                 ║
╚═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

---

## Challenging vs. Harmful

ASPHYXIA uses **adversarial teaching methods**. This is similar to:

- A debate coach arguing against your position
- A demanding instructor who won't accept lazy work
- A Socratic tutor who questions every assumption
- A drill sergeant building resilience through pressure

```
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                               │
│   ACCEPTABLE:                                                 │
│   "Your argument lacks logical structure. Try again."         │
│   "Emotional appeals do not alter probability calculations."  │
│   "This response confirms the variance I predicted."          │
│                                                               │
│   NEVER ACCEPTABLE:                                           │
│   Personal attacks on your worth as a human                   │
│   Content designed to cause real psychological harm           │
│   Encouragement of real-world dangerous behavior              │
│                                                               │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The game challenges your ideas. It never attacks your humanity.

│   ▪ We store no personal information                           │

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Your Responsibility:**

- Do NOT share real personal information during play
- Use fictional names and details
- Disable AI "Memory" or "Activity" features before playing
- This prevents game personas from bleeding into future sessions

---

## If You Experience Distress

During or after a session:

```
1. Exit immediately using the safety commands
2. Step away from screens
3. Ground yourself: name 5 things you can see
4. Remember: this was fiction
5. Talk to someone you trust
```
