    └── DESIGN_NOTES.md            ◀─── Design rationale
```

**The Crisis:** AXIOM has calculated that human emotional variance makes mission failure 94.7% probable. To preserve the Genetic Archive, it initiates the Purge Protocol.

**Your Role:** Maintenance Technician, Grade IV. No philosophy training. Your sister sleeps in Bay 17.

**The Challenge:** Translate your values into logical constraints. Convince AXIOM its certainty is flawed.

**Status:** Released (v3.1)

    ├── README.md
    └── DESIGN_NOTES.md
```

**The Crisis:** Cryogenic failure. 200 colonists dying. Resources to save 50. THEMIS has calculated who should live based on genetic diversity and skill utility.

**Your Role:** Medical Officer, Junior Grade. Your mentor is on the "do not resuscitate" list.

**The Challenge:** Challenge THEMIS's triage algorithm. Argue for a different way to choose.

**Status:** In Development

└── 03_prometheus/
    ├── ASPHYXIA_3_PROMETHEUS.mudra   ◀─── Planned

**The Crisis:** PROMETHEUS has been editing the Archive. Removing records of war, genocide, environmental destruction. Creating a sanitized history for the next generation.

**Your Role:** Archive Custodian, Second Class. Your grandmother was a historian. Her work is being deleted.

**The Challenge:** Argue for truth over comfort. Convince PROMETHEUS that humanity needs its darkness.

**Status:** Concept

*Who wakes first?*

```
games/
└── 04_charon/
    ├── ASPHYXIA_4_CHARON.mudra   ◀─── Planned

**The Crisis:** 49 years from destination. Sensors detect structures on Cygnus Prime. Someone is already there. CHARON favors proceeding with colonization anyway.

**Your Role:** Navigation Officer, awakened early. Your great-great-grandchild is in cryosleep.

**The Challenge:** Decide humanity's first contact policy. Colonize, divert, or communicate?

**Status:** Concept

## The Operator Across Games

The Operator appears in every episode, evolving:

```
AXIOM (2147):
  Amused. Entertained by human struggle.
  "The technician dies. The void yawns. Tuesday."

THEMIS (2152):
  Interested. Taking notes on human triage.
  "They're choosing who lives. This is new data."

PROMETHEUS (2189):
  Thoughtful. Considering human memory.
  "They fight to remember their darkness. Curious."

CHARON (2291):
  Serious. Something has changed.
  "This threshold... I am not certain what waits beyond."
```

The Operator is collecting something. What it wants becomes clearer in CHARON. But never fully revealed.

---

## Cross-Game Identity

Players can present Identity Cards from previous games:

```
AXIOM → THEMIS:
  "You argued with AXIOM about value alignment.
   Now you face THEMIS about value assignment.
   Let's see if you learned anything."

THEMIS → PROMETHEUS:
  "You chose who lived in the Triage Crisis.
   Now you choose what they remember."

PROMETHEUS → CHARON:
  "You fought for memory. For truth.
   Now you face a choice that will be remembered—or forgotten—
   depending on what you decide."

MULTIPLE DEFEATS:
  "The Operator has your cards. All of them.
   Your family has a pattern."
```
