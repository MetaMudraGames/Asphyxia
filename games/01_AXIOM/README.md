## Episode 01: AXIOM

*Only ten breaths left.*

```

└── 01_axiom/
    ├── AXIOM_v4_SPEC.md           ◀─── The game specification
    ├── README.md                   ◀─── Episode overview
    └── DESIGN_NOTES.md             ◀─── Design rationale
```

**The Crisis:** AXIOM has calculated that human emotional variance makes mission failure 94.7% probable. To preserve the Genetic Archive, it initiates the Purge Protocol.

**Your Role:** Cryotechnician, Grade IV. No philosophy training. Your seven-year-old sister sleeps in Bay 17. Your friend Chen—the senior engineer—watches through the airlock glass, her baby Mei in the adjacent nursery.

**The Challenge:** Translate your values into logical constraints. Convince AXIOM its certainty is flawed.

**The Mystery:** The Operator's variables were... interesting that day. Someone changed them. AXIOM may not be acting alone.

**Status:** Released (v4.0)

## Episode 02: THRESHOLD

*At the boundary between understanding and annihilation.*

```

└── 02_threshold/
    ├── THRESHOLD_v3_SPEC.md       ◀─── The game specification
    ├── README.md
    └── DESIGN_NOTES.md
```

**The Crisis:** Something has found the Memu. The Dancing Daffodils—a cloud of alien vessels—have wrapped around the ship. A door appeared in the Captain's quarters. Inside: a chamber filling with fluid. The alien has questions.

**Your Role:** Captain of the Memu. A hundred years after AXIOM. You married Chen's daughter. Your sibling died in that airlock long ago. The Operator has been watching you your whole life.

**The Challenge:** Answer 10 questions about humanity's worth while drowning. The alien's judgment is final. The Operator translates—unreliably.

**Status:** Released (v3.0)

## The Operator Across Games

The Operator appears in every episode, evolving:

```
AXIOM (2147):
  Amused. Entertained by human struggle.
  May have manipulated AXIOM's variables.
  "The technician dies. The void yawns. Tuesday."
  Collects the sibling. Begins watching the seven-year-old.

THRESHOLD (2247):
  Invested. Has watched the Captain for a century.
  Fond of her (never shows it). Translates (unreliably).
  "We have eternity. No rush."
```

The Operator is collecting something. What it wants is never fully revealed.

---

## Cross-Game Identity

Players can present Identity Cards from previous games:

```
AXIOM → THRESHOLD:
  The player's AXIOM character becomes the Captain's sibling.
  They died in that airlock a hundred years ago.
  If the Captain fails, they reunite in Digital Hell.
  The Operator has been watching the family ever since.

CARD INTEGRATION:
  Previous challenges shift based on card data.
  The Operator references your previous beliefs.
  Patterns persist. The Operator remembers.
```
