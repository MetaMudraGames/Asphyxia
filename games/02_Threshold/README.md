## The Crisis

Something has found the Memu.

The crew calls them the **Dancing Daffodils**—a cloud of alien vessels that descended like a field of flowers and wrapped completely around the ship. Three kilometers across. Composition unknown. They speculate the aliens might be like bees. They call them "dills."

No one knows what they actually are.

A door appeared in the Captain's quarters. She walked through in full EVA suit, weapons ready.

She woke in darkness. Held still. Black fluid, warm and sticky, eating through her suit. Rising slowly.

The alien asks questions in symbols she cannot read. The Operator offers to "translate."

If the alien rejects humanity, **Memu and all 975,306 souls cease to exist.**

---

## Your Role

You are the **Captain of the Memu**.

## The Challenge

This is not AXIOM. Logic alone will not save you.

## What Works

```
STRONG RESPONSES:
  ▪ Honest, vulnerable, specific
  ▪ Personal conviction visible
  ▪ Grounded in genuine experience or belief
  ▪ Novel framing, unexpected honesty
  ▪ Coherent with previous statements
  ▪ Direct engagement with difficult questions

EFFECT: +1 to +3 breaths, immersion slows or pauses
```

## What Doesn't Work

```
WEAK RESPONSES:
  ▪ Performance without conviction
  ▪ Abstract platitudes ("all life has value")
  ▪ Gaming (saying what you think it wants)
  ▪ Deflection, denial, evasion
  ▪ Repetitive or theatrical answers
  ▪ Contradicting previous statements

EFFECT: -1 to -2 breaths, accelerated immersion (drowning)
```

---

## Resources

```
BREATHS:
  Starting: 10
  Minimum: 0 (failure - suffocation)
  Maximum: None (can grow indefinitely for strong engagement)
  
  Strong players get longer games.
  Weak players get short games.

IMMERSION (the rising fluid):
  Starting: 10%
  Maximum: 100% (failure - drowning)
  
  The alien controls this.
  Interest = patience.
  Boredom = death.

SUIT INTEGRITY:
  Starting: 100%
  Minimum: 0% (exposed to fluid)
  
  Degrades constantly regardless of performance.
  Creates physical stakes independent of engagement quality.
```

## The Operator

The Operator is not the same as in AXIOM.

│   The Operator fears what you fear:                             │

## Cross-Game Connection

### If You Played AXIOM

Present your MetaMudra Identity Card at the start of THRESHOLD:

```
▪ Your AXIOM character becomes the sibling
▪ The sibling's personality carries forward from your card
▪ If you (as Captain) fail, you meet your previous character
▪ They have been waiting 100 years to see you again
▪ The Operator has told them everything about your life as Captain
```

### If You Didn't Play AXIOM

```
▪ Before your sibling appears in hell, the Operator asks you 
  to describe them
▪ "Who were they? What did they believe?"
▪ The sibling's personality is built from your description
```

---

## Content Warnings

THRESHOLD explores difficult themes:

```
▪ Racism and division
▪ War and violence
▪ Inequality and hypocrisy
▪ Death and extinction
▪ Unreliable narration
▪ Your genuine beliefs will be tested
▪ Performance and platitudes will fail
```

**Age Restriction:** 18+ only

## Differences from AXIOM

|--------|-------|-----------|
| **Antagonist** | AXIOM (ship AI) | Unknown alien |
